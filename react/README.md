## üîê Authentication System

This project includes a simple email/password login system powered by JWT and local storage.

### Authentication Flow:

* The login form authenticates via the backend `/login` endpoint.
* Upon success, a token and user info are stored in `localStorage`.
* Protected routes check for token validity.

### Key Files:

* `src/context/UserContext.jsx`: Provides global access to user state.
* `src/App.jsx`: Handles login, logout, and session persistence.

  * `handleLogin()` stores the token
  * `handleLogout()` clears the session
  * `useEffect()` restores the session on page refresh

### Navigation Behavior:

* Before login: nav shows **Login**
* After login: nav shows **Profile** and **Logout**
* `Profile` is a protected route (`<ProtectedRoute>`) that only renders for authenticated users
